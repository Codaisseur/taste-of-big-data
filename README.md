## What are we building?

Today we're building a movie recommendation app. The data comes from a dataset of 5000 movies. A basic HTML and CSS are provided, and together we'll implement all the javascript that is necessary to make some interesting lists:
* An all-time top 10
* A per-genre top 5
* The top 5 for your birth year

We will use the browser to make these lists visible.

'What are you waiting for?', you ask... Well, If you are all set, we will meet again in the first chapter!
