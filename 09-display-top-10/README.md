# Display the top 10

Glad we have the sorting and slicing done... Lets display it.

## What does it look like for one movie?

To display a movie, we should create an element in the page where we want to display our movie, and fill it with all the contents we need.

Lets consider the movie called [Tomorrowland](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/158852-tomorrowland?language=en)

The javascript object looks like this:
```js
{ title: "Tomorrowland", score: 6.2, votes: 2846, year: "2015-05-19" }
```

In HTML, it the contents for that movie should look like this:

```html
<div class="movie">
  <span class="movie title">Tomorrowland</span>
  <span class="movie year">2015-05-19</span>
  <span class="movie score">6.2</span>
  <span class="movie votes">2846</span>
</div>
```

### Generate an HTML element

If you create this HTML snippet in javascript, you can attach it to a parent element on your page, making it visible for your end user.
In the app, a place called 'Most popular movies' is waiting to be filled with sensible info.

Let's create a function that creates a div, with the four needed spans inside it. It should receive a `movie` object as input:

```js
var displayMovie = function(movie) {
  movieElement = document.createElement('div')
  movieElement.className = 'movie'

  movieElement.innerHTML = `
    <span class="movie title">${movie.title}</span>
    <span class="movie year ">${movie.year} </span>
    <span class="movie score">${movie.score}</span>
    <span class="movie votes">${movie.votes}</span>
  `

  return movieElement
}
```

If you have a movie object, you could use the function to create a movie element like so:

```js
// movie looks like this:
// { title: "Tomorrowland", score: 6.2, votes: 2846, year: "2015-05-19" }

var elementForTomorrowland = movieElement(movie)
console.log(elementForTomorrowland)
```
This will log in your console:
```html
<div class="movie">
  <span class="movie title">Tomorrowland</span>
  <span class="movie year ">2015-05-19 </span>
  <span class="movie score">6.2</span>
  <span class="movie votes">2846</span>
</div>
```
Exactly what we need, but not on the right place! It should be inside the HTML, not in the console. Lets make a small change.

At the end of the

> üôÑ Remember that I told you that strings with back tick are powerful?
>
> In the above code you see things like `${movie.title}`. That is a powerful way of *printing* the javascript value of `movie.title` *inside* the string.
>
> Also, with strings in back ticks you can let them span over multiple lines. That is very good for readability.

Lets make a change to the displayMovie function. At the end of it, we `return` it. But instead of it being returned, it should place the content on the page.

Remove the `return movieElement` line from the function. Now lets attach the generated HTML to the correct element on the page.

To do that, we need to get the element that we want to add to. Lets get it by its `id`. If we have the element, we want to append our movie HTML as a child element.

Add these 2 lines as a replacement to the return, to the bottom of the function body:

```js
  var mostPopularMovies = document.getElementById('most-popular')
  mostPopularMovies.appendChild(movieElement)
```

## Display the top 10

So we have a function that can give us a top 10, and we have a function that can place html elements on the screen. Time to stitch 'em together.

It would be nice if there was a way that we could run the `displayMovie` function for each element in our array. Lucky for us, Javascript provides!

Every array has a `forEach` function. That function allows you to run some code for every element in your array, and it is guaranteed to run in the correct order (which is kinda important for a top 10 )

From our **most popular** movies collection, we want - **for each** thing it contains - to **display** the **movie**.

Combining the bold words in Javascript, it gives us this code:

```js
// lets assume we have this 'mostPopular' collection
mostPopular.forEach(displayMovie);
```

> ü§ì Lets **break it down**.
>
> The `forEach` allows you to run a function (displayMovie) and it calls that function with each consecutive element in the array.
>
> In the above example, internally Javascript calls the displayMovie function 10 times; once per movie.

If you want to run this in the console, here is a snippet that could work:
```js
var moviesSortedOnScore = sortMovies(allMovies)
var mostPopular = topTen(moviesSortedOnScore)

mostPopular.forEach(displayMovie);
```

Convert that snippet into a function. We want to call it as soon as it is time. Immediately when PapaParse is done with the conversion is that time.

Putting it in a function also allows us to keep that code nice contained place and give it a good name!

Struggling to come up with a name? What about `displayMoviesAfterParsing`? It might not be best, but it expresses intent.

Place this function in your movies.js

```js
var displayMoviesAfterParsing = function () {
  var moviesSortedOnScore = sortMovies(allMovies)
  var mostPopular = topTen(moviesSortedOnScore)

  mostPopular.forEach(displayMovie);
}
```

And we want to run this code immediately on finishing parsing, right?

Lets add it to the `papaParseConfiguration`:

```js
var papaParseConfiguration = {
  // Keep this config at the bottom of this file!
  header: true,
  dynamicTyping: true,
  download: true,
  step: distillMovie,
  complete: displayMoviesAfterParsing,
}
```
Reload and behold the beauty!
